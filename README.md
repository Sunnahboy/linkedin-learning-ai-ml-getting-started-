# LinkedIn Learning: Getting Started with AI and Machine Learning

This repository contains notebooks and materials from LinkedIn Learning's **"Getting Started with AI and Machine Learning"** learning path. These examples demonstrate various machine learning and deep learning concepts applied to real-world problems, implemented in Python using TensorFlow and Keras.

## üöÄ Overview

This repository contains my implementations and exercises from the LinkedIn Learning path "Getting Started with AI and Machine Learning." The notebooks cover deep learning models for classification tasks, ranging from classic datasets to practical applications in text analysis and IT operations.

These materials are provided as a reference for those also taking the course or for anyone interested in practical deep learning examples.

## üìã Course Contents

This repository includes implementations from the LinkedIn Learning path, specifically from these modules:

### Classification Examples

- **Iris Classification (Deep Learning)** - Implementation of a deep neural network to classify the famous Iris flower dataset (Module 04).
- **Spam Classification** - Using natural language processing and deep learning to detect spam messages (Module 05).
- **IT Incident Root Cause Analysis** - Applying deep learning to automatically determine the root cause of IT incidents based on system metrics and error codes (Module 06).

## üìä Datasets

- `iris.csv` - The classic Iris flower dataset with measurements for three different species
- `Spam-Classification.csv` - Text messages labeled as spam or ham (not spam)
- `root_cause_analysis.csv` - Synthetic IT incident data with various system metrics and root cause labels

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Requirements

To run these notebooks, you'll need:

```
- Python 3.8+
